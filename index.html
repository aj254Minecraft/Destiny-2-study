<h2>A study of <i>Destiny 2</i> by Bungie</h2>
    In this site I want to explore the use of audio in <i>Destiny 2</i>

    the dialog and music sets the stage for a world you do not remember, and you have nothing to connect to that is familiar.
    It is the opposite of the "Mirror stage" by Lacan(Note 1), the Ghost is the only thing we have to draw any conclusions of who we are.
    Ghost resembles the symboloic, he is there to tell us of the new world which we reside in, although he does not tell us who we used to be.
    Instead Ghost explains our purpose and what we must do to survive.

    In the video Ghost explains all he had was a feeling when he chose to ressurect us, also in-game, it is known that the Guardian is controlled by the player.
    A consequence of this knowledge, is an enemy in-game who wants to be real, these wish dragons have made armor that imply anytime, we the player, use that armor
    we are closer to allowing these wish dragons a pathway to the real world. In a way this like "hailing us" a concept from Althusser (note 2).
